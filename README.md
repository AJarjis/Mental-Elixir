# Mental Elixir

## What it does?
Provides users with a site where they cna track their mental moods, join guilds and go on adventures in an RPG-like environment.

## So does it work?
Not entirely, will require some work to host locally and set up the database due to the nature of the project, however is possible so if you wish feel free to. No longer an active project.

## Why was it made?
Made for a Software Engineering coursework along with a group of fellow students, achieved high scores for our effort and taught us how to use Git and to stay away from JSP (Java Server Pages).
